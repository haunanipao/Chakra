# Chakra
All course files for the Chakra UI Crash Course on NetNinja.dev &amp; on the Net Ninja YouTube channel. It's a nice tutorial with short lessons. I like how the instructor invites you to play with the code using the documentation.  So far, I like how Chakra feels familiar to me and look clean.

This tutorial gave the best overall of learning key points and use frameworks I already know such as React, JS and Vite. It has no db transactions or use API, but it does have a json file used as data. You need to do install json-server and watch the json data to populate the cards. 

Going forward, I'll use this for playing with Chakra and try stuff.  So it will be different than the course. 
If you want to learn about Chakra UI, I recommend checking out the Youtube course. ðŸš€

# Chakra
All course files for the Chakra UI Crash Course on NetNinja.dev &amp; on the Net Ninja YouTube channel. It's a nice tutorial with short lessons.

This was to learn some things about Chakra UI for some projects and this tutorial gave the best overall of learning key things and use things I already know such as React, JS and Vite. 

Going forward, I'll use this for playing with Chakra.  Cheers.
